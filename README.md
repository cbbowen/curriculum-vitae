# [Cirriculum Vitae for Chris Bowen](https://cbbowen.github.io/curriculum-vitae/cbbowen.xml)

### Want to use this as a template?

Feel free!  I've released my CV under a license which (to the extent permissible by law) permits you can do whatever you like with it.

If you're familiar with XML, everything before the `<xsl:stylesheet>` element should be fairly self-explanatory.  Simply replace my information with yours.  Structural changes will require editing the following XSLT portion.  Lastly, you can change the apperance of any part of the document using CSS; just look for the `<style>` element.

As a bonus, the layout adjusts appropriately when printing if you need a PDF or physical copy.
